# HydroNyaSama

> [中文](README_zh.md)

**HydroNyaSama** is a Minecraft mod project ported and maintained by the **HydroLine** development team under [HydroCraft Server](https://wiki.hydcraft.cn).

The NyaSama series of mods were once very popular in the Minecraft community but have been discontinued since 2020. Starting from December 2025, we have been porting the NyaSama series to Minecraft 1.16.5/1.18.2/1.20.1 for both Forge and Fabric loaders using ArchitecturyAPI, with plans to support more versions based on the progress of the porting.

## ⚠️ Important Note

This ported version is still in active development and may contain bugs and compatibility issues. Please make sure to regularly back up your game saves to prevent data corruption or loss.

## 🔍 About the Original Project

The HydroLine development team has limited association with the original NyaSama development team [nsdn](https://github.com/nsdn). If you encounter any issues while using this mod, please report them in this repository instead of contacting the original mod developers.

We acknowledge and respect the contributions of the original development team. We may adjust or remove certain features or textures in accordance with the requirements of the original team.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Single codebase supporting both Forge and Fabric loaders for major Minecraft versions
- **MTR Integration**: Deep integration with Minecraft Transit Railway (MTR), providing interfaces for querying routes, stations, and real-time train data
- **Create Integration**: Compatible with Create Mod, supporting stress network and device status reading (1.18.2+)
- **Unified Communication Protocol**: Communicates with Bukkit plugins via Plugin Messaging Channels, supporting JSON-formatted RPC calls
- **Shared Registration System**: Declares blocks and items in the Common layer, automatically adapting to registration APIs of each version
