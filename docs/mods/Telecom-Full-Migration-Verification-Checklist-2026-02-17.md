# Telecom Full Migration Verification Checklist - 2026-02-17

## Usage
- Mark `[x]` only after in-game/manual validation passes.
- `Status` is current migration mapping, not proof of behavior parity.
- Keep evidence (screenshots/logs) for each checked item.

## High-Risk Manual Scenarios (Must Pass)
- [ ] Telecom visual parity: signal box shell/lamp/button/sign positions match legacy in all rotations.
- [ ] Editable gate behavior: expected lamp visibility and redstone input/output parity across 1.16.5/1.18.2/1.20.1.
- [ ] No unexpected action-bar text on right-click for telecom blocks/tools.
- [ ] NGTablet non-sneak edit and sneak run both work; `pages` and `code` formats both execute.
- [ ] `/ngt` command set/run/clear works on Fabric+Forge all target versions.
- [ ] NSPGA profile flow (`nspga_io/inputs/outputs/code/show/clear`) applies and persists as expected.
- [ ] Connector/DevEditor/NGTablet interactions do not regress link/runtime state transitions.

## Version Matrix Sign-off
- [ ] Fabric 1.16.5
- [ ] Fabric 1.18.2
- [ ] Fabric 1.20.1
- [ ] Forge 1.16.5
- [ ] Forge 1.18.2
- [ ] Forge 1.20.1

## Final Gate
- [ ] `./gradlew.bat buildTarget_1_16_5 buildTarget_1_18_2 buildTarget_1_20_1`
- [ ] This checklist +日报 updated in same commit.
